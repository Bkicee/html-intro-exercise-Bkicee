        <h2>Chelsea</h2>
        <p class="second">I am a member of NYU men's soccer team when I went local at ShangHai. I was also a member of my high school soccer team as well. My favorite soccer team is Chelsea and I start chasing them since 2013. My favorite player is Eden Hazard and that is the reason why I choose my position as left wings in the real life. He is one of the best strikers in the world at his prime, and I learned a lot from his faith in soccer, which is to study or work or playing sports with joyful and happiness.</p>
